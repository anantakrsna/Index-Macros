# Index-Macros

The intent of this project is to create a set of macros for indexing. 

I am a Sky user so macros will initially be built for Sky. Other software may later be included. 

They will be built using AutoHotKey which is open source software which can be found at [here.](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

Adrian (aka Ananta Krishna dasa)

## Installation

Install Autohotkey from their website.

Download the index-macro.ahk.

Run index-macro.ahk.

The script can be edited with a text editor.

## Usage

| Hotkey | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Win+Ctrl+c | Copy text to main Roman |
| Win+Ctrl+Shift+c | Copy text to main Roman plural |
| Win+Alt+c | Copy text with italic |
| Win+Alt+Shift+c | Copy text to main italic plural |
| --- | --- |
| Win+Ctrl+a | Copy to sub, Roman |
| Win+Shift+a | Copy to sub, Roman plural |
| Win+Shift+a | Copy to sub, Roman plus "and" |
| Win+Shift+alt+a | Copy to sub, Roman plural and "and" |

## Known issues

I found it buggy on my Windows 10 laptop but it works fine on my Windows 11 desktop. Don't know why. So please test with a test index and watch the results while using. 

Problems may occur if a record is still being edited.
