# Index-Macros

The intent of this project is to create a set of macros for indexing. 

I am a Sky user so macros will initially be built for Sky. Other software may later be included. 

They will be built using AutoHotKey which is open source software which can be found at [here.](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
