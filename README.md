# Index-Macros

The intent of this project is to create a set of macros for indexing. 

I am a Sky user so macros will initially be built for Sky. Other software may later be included. 

They will be built using AutoHotKey which is open source software which can be found at [here.](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Installation

Install Autohotkey from their website.

## Known issues

I found it buggy on my Windows 10 laptop but it works fine on my Windows 11 desktop. Don't know why. So please test with a test index and watch the results while using. 

Problems may occur if a record is still being edited.
